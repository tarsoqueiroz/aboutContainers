## Introduction

In this Redis crash course, we're going to talk about Redis and how Redis can be used as a primary database for complex applications that need to store data in multiple formats.

1. First we will see what Redis is and its usages as well as why it is suitable for modern complex
m.croservice applications. 
2. We will talk about how Redis supports storing multiple data formats for different purposes through its modules.
3. Next we will see how Redis as an in-memory database can persist data and recover from data loss.
4. We'll also talk about how Redis optimizes memory storage cost using Redis on Flash.
5. Then we will see very interesting use cases of scaling Redis and replicating it across multiple geographic regions and 
6. Finally since one of the most popular platforms for running microservices is Kubernetes and since running stateful applications in Kubernetes is a bit challenging, we will see how you can easily run Redis on Kubernetes.
