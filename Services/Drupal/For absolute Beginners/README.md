## Introduction

What is Drupal?

Think of Drupal as an **API-first, content-structured CMS built on a flexible, entity-based data model**. It's a **web application framework** that uses a CMS as its primary, out-of-the-box distribution.
Key Differentiators for an IT Pro

- **Data Model First:** Unlike systems where content is a "post" with a fixed body, Drupal's core is a **generalized Entity-Field system**. You define your content types (e.g., Article, Product, Employee) by adding custom fields (text, image, reference, etc.). This makes it a natural fit for complex, structured data.
- **Decoupled by Design:** While it's a fully-featured traditional CMS, its modern architecture is **API-first**. It can natively serve as a headless backend, delivering content via JSON:API or GraphQL to any front-end (React, Vue, native mobile apps).
- **Enterprise-Grade Core:** It's built for scale, security, and multilingual needs out-of-the-box. Its access control system is exceptionally granular and powerful.
- **Modern Foundation:** Since Drupal 8, it's been rebuilt on **Symfony (PHP) components**, adopting modern OOP, Composer for dependency management, and rigorous coding standards.

The Simplest Analogy

- **WordPress** is a brilliant, specialized tool for building **websites centered around a "blog-post" paradigm**.
- **Drupal** is a **content modeling engine and framework** for building **web applications and complex digital experiences** where content structure is non-trivial.

In a Nutshell: If the project is a simple brochure site, Drupal is overkill. If it's a university site, a government portal, a multi-brand corporate site, or a complex web application with intricate content relationships and workflows, Drupal is a top-tier contender.

It's the system you use when your primary challenge is **structuring and governing content**, not just publishing it.
