This course promises an introduction with practical exercises to learn Tekton CI/CD Pipelines at an expert level.

## Introduction

In recent years, the IT landscape has experienced significant transformations, with the emergence of Cloud, DevOps, and GitOps, each advocating a particular philosophy and introducing a multitude of tools. These philosophies share a common goal: to enhance companies' software development and application delivery procedures. Within this context, the concepts of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) have gained prominence, referring to the mechanisms facilitating seamless integration and deployment processes.

DevOps initially aimed to bridge the gap between Development and Operations teams. However, another barrier remained: establishing a unified platform capable of accommodating both Development and Operations infrastructures, ensuring agility and scalability to meet evolving team requirements. This requirement underscores the importance of leveraging Kubernetes and the Cloud effectively. This discussion will delve into Cloud-Native and Kubernetes-Native Pipelines, with TEKTON emerging as a technology adept at fulfilling these demands, a focus of this course.

Course Objective: This course endeavors to equip participants with the necessary skills to implement TEKTON for automating CI/CD processes within a Kubernetes environment.

Compared to Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, and similar platforms, Tekton stands out as uniquely cloud-native, making it exceptionally well-suited for the cloud-native ecosystem.

If you're passionate about cloud-native technologies and you want to keep up with recent technologies, this course is tailored specifically for you.
