## About this course 

Docker is an open source project that makes it easy to create containers and container-based apps. Docker's lightweight and portable software containers simplify application development, testing, and deployment.

We just released a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will help you learn the core fundamentals of Docker by building a Node/Express app with a MongoDB and Redis database.

Sanjeev Thiyagarajan developed this course. Sanjeev has a ton of experience working with Docker and he is thoroughly qualified to teach this course.

First, you will learn how to use a single container. Gradually you will add more complexity to the app by integrating a MongoDB container and then finally adding in a Redis database for authentication.

You will learn how to do things manually with the cli and also how to use Docker compose. The course focuses on the challenges of moving from a development environment to a production environment. You will learn how to deploy with a Ubuntu VM as the production server and utilize a container orchestrator like Docker Swarm to handle rolling updates.
