# Getting Course Resources? (GitHub Repo)

> Nav: [Back to What You'll Learn](../what-youll-learn.md)

All the examples and assignment files are in a single code repository on GitHub.

Each folder represents a single lecture section (but not all lectures have a folder, as not all need code). 
You should clone this repo to a folder on your desktop or somewhere on your computer.

Clone the github repository:
```sh 
  git clone https://github.com/galonge/udemy-kustomize-mastery
```
If you're rather new to GitHub, you can download the GUI to make it very easy to push/pull code at https://desktop.github.com/ for Mac and Windows. 
A great alternative Git client is https://www.gitkraken.com/.

We won't use git much in this course but knowing the basics of pulling code, committing code, and pushing updates could be helpful.
